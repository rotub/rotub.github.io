> I skateboarded 85km from Sydney to Wollongong. It took me 12 hours. Here is the video.

If you haven't read my story, you can do so here.

When skateboarding 85km from Sydney to Wollongong was just a possiblity, I planned to tweet the whole journey, take lots of photos, and create a detailed video.

I did skateboard the 85km from Sydney to Wollongong but tweets, photos and videos didn't entirely work out as planned. That is because it was a somewhat last minute decision, and also because that day had the worst weather Sydney had seen in years; my iPhone and Flip HD were literally non-responsive, or bricked from water damage.

But if I wanted everything perfect, I would have put it off again and likely never have done it at all. I submitted to the fact that by not having these things my story would not attract much attention.

I was proved wrong though, when the initial blog post I wrote managed to get on the frontpage of Hacker News, Reddit Australia, Gizmodo and Medium.

I managed to get some video footage on the day which you can watch above. I think it may give a different perspective, to my writing, of what my day was like.

Thanks to everyone who shared, retweeted, Liked and read my story.

 

Thanks to Bec for making the video.
