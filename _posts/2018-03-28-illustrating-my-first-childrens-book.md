4 years ago I started reading childrens books which helped me build confidence in reading books cover-to-cover. It didn’t take long before I moved on to adult books and it has stayed with me — recently I've finished reading The Martian, The Barefoot Investor, and Elon Musk’s biography. I’m currently reading Artemius.

While reading childrens books i developed a new appreciation for them - specifically illustrated books. i started thinking that maybe one day i would like to illstrate and write one of my own.

So i was happy when Rachel Bes approached me and said she was writing a childrens book and wanted to know if i would be interested in illustrating it. She told me she wanted to tell a story about a kid who loves to be brave and try new things. After our first discussion on how we would run things I went home and started designing the character.

### Designing the character

I had little idea how to design a character. I had been learning to draw by copying photographs and other people’s work. This was the first time I was creating something from scratch. The amount of possibilities was overwhelming. The learning curve was steep but it proved to be the right time for pursuing these new skills.

It’s an amazing feeling to make something from nothing and here I was creating a person. Calling it a daunting task is an understatement. Every facial or body feature I added, tweaked, or removed in turn changed The Little Adventurers persona.

###Tying down the design

Little did I know how much she would evolve and change the more I got to know her. If you compare the initial sketches to the final design today they look nothing alike. I much prefer today’s design.

There were a few important points that developed over time while designing The Little Adventurer that helped me solidify her appearance.

- It would be a girl. Exploring and adventuring is often associated with boys. We didn’t want to add to this misconception.
- She would be a little weird & quirky. Something needed to stand out about her, so she would be instantly recognisable.
- She did not need to be fit, tall, or skinny. Again exploring and adventuring can be associated with fitness and appearance. I don’t want kids to feel they need to be anything they’re not to try new things.

The most notable feature — her beanie — and specifically its long tassels is what makes The Little Adventurer instantly recognisable.

Symbolically, they keep her safe as she explores new grounds. She can tie her tassels to something and go anywhere — knowing she can always follow them back to where she started. Otherwise they grow, shrink, and adjust to her surrounds.

Artistically, they can be used to show where she has been, emotions she is feeling, and assist her with doing tasks whether it be climbing, swinging, holding, pulling, etc. The possibilities are endless — much like the list of adventurers she wants to embark on.

###Practice makes progress

Ironically, the biggest challenge I experienced while illustrating The Little Adventurer was my own improving skills. Every page I finished I compared to the previous and would think to myself “Oh no this one is so much better. I have improved too much, and now I have to redraw the other pages”.

I redrew lots of pages, lots of times. I wanted to make every page perfect. I quickly learned however that my skills, tastes, and style will always be evolving and so my sense of what is perfect will always be evolving too.

###Drawn to life

I started drawing two years ago with no goal in mind. Surprisingly that’s how I stayed motivated. If I started drawing with the goal of illustrating this book I would have failed. I learned to draw so I could draw — not so I could create a book.

I was nervous to start this project because it meant drawing was no longer only a hobby. I was putting my skills to something that I wanted to complete and possibly make money from. This wasn’t going to be a whim project that would fizzle out; I was going to finish it.

Finding time to draw can be difficult. The perfect time to draw turns out to be the exact moment I feel like doing nothing at all. Essentially, I have time to draw when I don’t feel like drawing. When the inevitable urge comes to sit on the couch and watch TV I know it’s an opportunity to make progress on drawing. Sometimes I seize those opportunities.

The aim of The Little Adventurer is to inspire kids to be brave and try new things. I think that’s an important message to communicate to boys and girls in todays world.
