The most challenging part of being a web developer is how quickly things change.

I think I magnify this feeling by reading Hacker News every morning. Seeing what people are building, often in their free time, while inspiring, it can be overwhelming. With every new language or framework it's hard not to feel like everything is moving too fast and there being too many things to learn.
