### All you need to know about working for Deliveroo in Amsterdam

Do you live in the Netherlands and considering joining Deliveroo as a rider?

I joined Deliveroo in September 2017 after moving to Amsterdam from Australia on a Working Holiday Visa.

I couldn't find information online about the job - like how much it pays and other general details. So I have been gathering data on my experience for the past 6 months. I'm sharing these statistics with you so you can see what it entails and make a judgement call on whether it suits your needs. In return, if you do decide to sign up - enter my referal code, **RO120601**, when [applying](http://roo.it/RO120601 "Apply here"). You will receieve a bonus for doing so - at the time of writing that bonus is €100.

I've worked more than 94 shifts and completed over 743 deliveries from 254 restaurants.
