> I don't want to _learn_ how to draw, I just want to be _able_ to draw.

I've been learning how to draw lately and it's frustrating.

To picture exactly what I want to draw and then observe what my hands actually do is really annoying.

I don't want to _learn_ how to draw, I just want to be _able_ to draw. That sounds really lazy but it's the truth. So i have started to ask myself why i feel this way because it's not just with drawing that I feel like this.

##I don't like being shit at something

I think i'm relatively good at a few things like skateboarding, surfing, and making websites.

But I noticed recently that I've been resisting to try or learn anything different. I have desires and creative endeavours that I do not pursue because I know that initially i will be shit at them. And I don't like being that.

It's a long time since I've learned something new by trying over and over and over again to finally succeed and celebrate.

The last time I remember having that feeling would be when I landed a new skateboard trick when I was 15. That's pretty sad, but mostly true.

##I only learn within my comfort zone

My comfort zone is the internet. Ever since I built my first website I felt like I had found my playground - where I didn't have anyone to compare myself to and could create without feeling judged by myself or by others.

I've learned a lot as a web developer because it's a fast moving industry. I have no choice but to learn new tools and languages often so that I don't fall behind.

> Expanding on things i already know and telling myself i am learning new things is easier than actually learning something completely new.

When I learn something new that is web-related, I receive bite-sized bursts of endorphins and it feels good. But I've only learned something 'new' by applying what I already know in a different way. Like someone learning how to ride a motorbike when they already know how to ride a bicycle. It's different but kind of the same.

Expanding on things i already know and telling myself i am learning new things is easier than actually learning something completely new.

##I don't believe in my hands

Somehow, somewhere, I convinced myself that I am no good with my hands. I can't build furniture, I don't do craft, I don't draw, I am not good at DIY around the house. That's for people who are good with their hands. _Why even try? When I do, it turns out shit_.

In reality I know I'm not that bad. But I compare myself to others who are great and that makes me think that I'm not, and never can be. I'm not one of them, and I shouldn't try to be.

##Pulling my ~~finger~~ pencil out

That's a super sad and sorry state to live in - not persuing something because of the fear that i might fail.

Drawing and art in general has always been something I am interested in pursuing. I've always seen it as something that other people do though. Whenever I try to draw it turns out looking really bad and I use that as an excuse to tell myself to give up and _build a website instead_. Because that's what I do.

Learning from this I've started teaching myself how to draw.
