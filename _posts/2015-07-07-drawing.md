I am good at making websites, and often use it as a channel to express my creativity. Creating websites is interesting, challenging, rewarding, and like anything else creative it takes a lot of time and energy.

I look back at my journey of learning how to code websites and I am proud of my efforts. It's a good skill to have in todays world but at what price have I purchased it? I have started to realise that I am addicted to being creative _on the web_. When I want to be creative, I make a new web-[site](http://www.movii.es) or web-[app](http://hn.rotub.me). And I'm starting to ask myself: why?
