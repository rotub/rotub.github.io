**Learning something brand new is not easy.**

I'm learning how to draw and I hate it. I find it demotivating and frustrating. To be able to picture exactly what I want to produce and then observe what my hands actually do is really annoying.

> I don't want to learn how to draw, I just want to be able to draw.

That sounds really lazy, and im exaggerating a little, but its how i feel. So i have started to ask myself why i feel this way.

**I don't like being shit at something **

I think i'm relatively good at a few things like skateboarding, surfing, and making websites.

But I noticed recently that I've been resisting to try or learn anything different. I have desires and creative endeavours that I do not pursue because I know that initially i will be shit at them. And I don't like being that.

It's a long time since I've learned something new by trying over and over and over again to finally succeed and celebrate.

The last time I remember having that feeling would be when I landed a new skateboard trick when I was 15. That's pretty sad, but mostly true.

**I only learn within my comfort zone**

My comfort zone is the internet. I've learned a lot as a web developer because it's a fast moving industry. I have no choice but to learn new tools and languages often so that I don't fall behind.

When I learn something new that is web-related, bite-sized bursts of endorphins rush through me and it feels good. But I've only learned something 'new' by applying what I already know in a different way. Like something learning how to run when they already know how to walk. Or learning to ride a motorbike when they already know how to ride a bicycle. It's different but kind of the same.

Expanding on things i already know and telling myself i am learning new things is easier than actually learning something completely new.

**I don't believe in my hands**

Somehow, somewhere, I convinced myself that I am no good with my hands. I can't build furniture, I don't do craft, I don't draw, I am not good at DIY around the house. _That's for people who are good with their hands_. Why try because when I do it turns out shit. But really I'm not that bad. I'm pretty good but I compare myself to others who are great and that makes me think that I'm not and never can be. I'm not one of them, and I shouldn't try to be. My place is with virtual hands on the internet. I don't use my hands in the real world.
