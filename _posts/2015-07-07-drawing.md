I am good at making websites, and often use it as a channel to express my creativity. Creating websites is interesting, challenging, rewarding, and like anything else creative it takes a lot of time and energy.

I have spent years learning how to make web browsers do what I want, but what do I have today to show for those hours of work? It's difficult to create a legacy on the internet because it's a whole new world every day. It costs money to keep things afloat. Domains and hosting expire. Projects come and go.

I look back at my journey of learning how to code websites and am proud of my efforts.
