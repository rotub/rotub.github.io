**Learning something brand new is not easy.**

I'm learning how to draw and I hate it. I find it demotivating and frustrating. To be able to picture exactly what I want to produce and then observe what my hands actually do is really annoying.

> I don't want to learn how to draw, I just want to be able to draw.

That sounds really lazy, and im exaggerating a little, but its how i feel. So i have started to ask myself why i feel this way.

**I don't like being shit at something **

I think i'm relatively good at a few things like skateboarding, surfing, and making websites. But I noticed recently that I've been resisting to try anything different. I have other desires and creative endeavours, but I don't pursue them, because I know that initially i will be shit at it.

It's a long time since I've learned something new by trying over and over and over again to finally pull it off and celebrate.

The last time I remember having that feeling would be when I landed a new skateboard trick when I was 15. That's pretty sad, but mostly true.

**Comfort zone skills**

> I've learned a lot these past few years but I've only learned within my comfort zone.

My comfort zone is the internet. I've learned a lot as a web developer because it's a fast moving industry. I have no choice but to learn new tools and languages often so that I don't fall behind.

I thought i was good at learning new things. When I learn something new web-related bite-sized bursts of endorphins rush through me because I've learned something 'new' by applying what I already know in a different way. Like learning how to run when you already know how to walk. Or learning to ride a motorbike when you already know how to ride a bicycle. They're different but kind of the same.

Expanding on things i know in one area and telling myself i am learning new things is easier than learning completely new things. I've become addicted to the rush i get from learning off the back of things i already know and scared of learning from the bottom again in a whole new enenvironment.
