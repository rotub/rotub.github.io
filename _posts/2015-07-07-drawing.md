I am good at making websites, and often use it as a channel to express my creativity. Creating websites is interesting, challenging, rewarding, and like anything else creative it takes a lot of time and energy.

I look back at my journey of learning how to code websites and I am proud of my efforts. It's a good skill to have in todays world but at what price have I purchased it? I have started to realise that I am addicted to being creative _on the web_. When I want to be creative, I make a new [website](http://www.movii.es) or web [app](http://hn.rotub.me). I'm starting to ask myself: why?

It's been a long time since I learned something new. Not on the web. I learn how to use and write new tools and languages on the web every day. If not hands-on then I am reading a million blog posts about what someone else is building and wishing I was them. Because they are current. They know the latest. They're better than me.
