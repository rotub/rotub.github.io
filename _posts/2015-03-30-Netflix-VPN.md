Netflix launched in Australia this month and while i didn't plan on using it at all, they offer your first month free, so i have been using it over the last couple of weeks and i'm actually really inpressed.

I've consumed Netflix content via my laptop, Playstation 3, iPhone, and streamed to my Chromecast/TV. All of these ways have worked perfectly without lag or connection issues. It is just so easy to use.

There is only one thing holding me back from wanting to stay signed up and start paying the $11.99 per month. Content.

I want to be able to watch all my TV shows and movies in one place.
