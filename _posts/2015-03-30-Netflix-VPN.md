Netflix launched in Australia this month and while i didn't plan on using it at all, they are offering your first month as a free trial. I have been using it over the last couple of weeks and i'm actually really impressed.

I've consumed Netflix content via my laptop, Playstation 3, iPhone, and streamed to my TV with my Chromecast. All of which have worked perfectly without lag or connectivity issues. It is so easy to use, and each device can pick up from where i left off on another.

But. There are two things holding me back from wanting to stay signed up after my free trial and start paying the $11.99 per month. 

- Content
- Offline support

**Content.** I want to be able to watch all my TV shows and movies anywhere and anytime. At this stage i will be paying $11.99 for access to a couple of my shows and a small selection of movies. I realise it's exceptionally difficult to gain liscensing for shows and movies across networks but the reality is services like Popcorn Time exist and already provide exactly that. I realise popcorn time is not exactly legal but knowing it exists for free makes $11.99 seem expensive for such little content.

**Offline Support.** I spend 4 hours commuting everyday. i could watch a movie on the way to work and one on the way home. But no. That would eat my data. If only i could save content (within the app) to play later/offline. This doesn't exist and apparently Netflix are not planning to add this feature. sad times.
