####The hardest part about drawing

The hardest part about learning to draw isn't the drawing. It's finding time to draw and then still being motivated once I do.

My daily commute adds up to 3 hours of train travel per day. I thought I would get that time to practice, but I've realised the train isn't an ideal environment for drawing; with its interruptions, bumping, and shaking carriages. And half the time I don't have a seat.

####When I draw

My prime time for drawing has landed on lunch time at work and late at night. In reality though, I find it difficult to draw anywhere outside of lunchâ€”when I feel most awake, and having been staring at a computer for a few hours self-motivation seems to take care of itself.

While every drawing doesn't excite me or blow me out of the water, I am seeing progress. This week I tried drawing a new face - Jennifer Lawrence. I'm beginning to understand why and how having drawing fundamentals in the back of your mind makes a big difference while drawing. When Jennifer Lawrence I felt as though I was approaching the task from a different angle and rather than trying to do it the "right way" i did it the way that feels right for me.

I enjoy working with light and shadows. This week I picked up softer pencils to help add depth to my work. To be honest I've noticed little difference so far, but can see the more confident I get in making my dark areas really dark and my highlights really light, this confidence in contrast will greatly improve my finished work.
