####Finding time

When I decided I would get good at drawing I figured I had a lot of time on my hands in which to learn.

As it turns out though, most the time i dont have a seat on the train or its too bumpy. The idea of having 3 hours of solid practice kind of went out the window.

My most reliable time is at work during my lunch break. This can be hard because i have to switch on my desire to draw at defined times.

During a work week i have small windows to practise:

**700-745:** My alarm goes off at 7 and this would be a good time to jumo out bed and do some scribbles but i haven't been able to do this yet because i am too lazy.

745-900: 

**1230-130:** Lunch. This is where i get drawing done. i find im in a good headspace around this time, calm, and motivated to get off the computer and do something different



This week I have been drawing shapes and shadows.
