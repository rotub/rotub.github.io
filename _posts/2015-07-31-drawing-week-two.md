####Finding time

I decided I would get good at drawing and not concern myself with how long it might take because i figured i had a lot of time on my hands in which to learn. I spend a lot of time on the train each day commuting to and from work. _3-4 hours per day actually_.

It's still not easy though. Most the time i dont have a seat on the train or its too bumpy. The idea of having 3 hours of solid practice kind of went out the window.

My most reliable time is at work during my lunch break. I've realised learning is quite hard because i have to switch on my desire to draw at defined times.

During a work week 

This week I have been drawing shapes and shadows.
