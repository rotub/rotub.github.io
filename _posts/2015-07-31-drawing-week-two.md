I was excited when I started learning to draw. I decided I would get good at drawing and not concern myself with how long it might take. I spend a lot of time on the train each day commuting to and from work. _3-4 hours per day actually_. Finding time to draw was not going to be a problem.

This week has been a struggle. I have been drawing shapes and shadows. It's important to do and learn but it soooo boring. Every now and then I will fall back to drawing something else.
