> When I started taking drawing seriously, I made a point not to take the tools seriously.

I was excited when I started learning to draw. I decided I would get good at drawing and not concern myself with how long it might take. I spend a lot of time on the train each day commuting to and from work. _3-4 hours per day actually_. Finding time to draw was not going to be a problem.
