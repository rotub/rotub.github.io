![Porters on Mt Kilimanjaro](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1730420/6816856/dbb71750-d2ec-11e4-9ec1-65b3be85ddab.JPG)

Few people carry more than a single day pack on Mt. Kilimanjaro. All the "stuff" is carred by porters.

Some people opt-out of having a porter and carry their own gear (i think I spotted 3 people in total); it's something I considered but seeing as the question was never asked, I was happy to have porters carry mine.

Even before arriving I had a great interest in the porters. I read a few blog posts and guidebooks about Mt. Kilimanjaro. Porters are always a passing comment. I wanted to know more about them, how much they carry, and observe them firsthand.


**Perspective**

Each porter carries roughly 18kg on their back, neck or head. Plus their own gear. To be sure, at the beginning and end of each day, every single porter must "weigh in" to ensure the weight has been evenly distributed through the entire colony. It was nice to learn that specific measures are put in place so each porter is treated equally.

This means a big pack is actually the same weight as a small one. On day one the different sized packs would pass and I felt sorry for the guys with the bigger or "heavier" packs. But once again things were put into perspective.

**Tipping**

One big and unavoidable element of a Kili climb is tipping. You must tip your guide, assistant guide, cook, waiter, and serveral porters. Before my climb I was saddened by the fact that porters are paid badly and are also tipped the least amount out of everyone.

They carry the gear. They carry the food. They setup camp. They fetch and carry the water from the streams. They are the hard workers.

However, I learned on this trip that every porter is actually on their way to become a guide. And every guide was once a porter. It makes sense now, but I hadn't thought about that. A porter can become an assistant guide after 3 years and then a guide after a further 2 or 3.


**Hard workers**

Nothing can hide the fact that they are the hardest workers on the mountain.

They're not old either. I expected to have men carring my gear but the average porter I would said was 20-23. They weren't big, they weren't built. They were teenagers. A minimum age of 18 is in place and by the look of it 18 year olds are quick to sign up.

They are really inspiring. They work hard but they work together and at the end of a long, hard day, they sit around and smile, joke, sing, and laugh.

They sing a Kilimanjaro song, sometimes as they walk, which roughly translates to a song about the mountain and having no worries while on it.

One porter fell and hurt his back one day. It was a sad sight but it was moreso encouraging to see 6 porters carry their friend on a stretcher, with several hours of hiking ahead.

Porters are the real heroes of Mt. Kilimanjaro. They define hard work.

They inspired me and hopefully they will inpsire you when you climb Kili one day, which you should do.
