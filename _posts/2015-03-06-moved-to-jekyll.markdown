**A few weeks ago** I decided that my site needed a change. It was already pretty simple but I wanted to simplify it even further.

I've endeavoured to make this blog about all things _unrelated_ to my work, and instead focus on art, writing, travel, and micro-adventures. I'm still going to try and focus on those things.

**Clean up**

I have only included popular posts from my website. I've cut the fat and stripped the site back to basics to build from starting now.
