I've been running this blog for a few years now.

I've made an effort to make this website about all things outside of work and the web. Instead, I have focused on writing, art, travel, and micro-adventures.

For this post I want to touch on my thought process while updating this website in the past few weeks.

**The web moves fast**

In the couple of years since I built the first version of this site the web has changed a lot. At the time, I wanted to create and build my own CMS, which I did successfully and have been using to update the site for years. I love simplifying stuff and when I looked into what I needed for a blog Wordpress looked way to _complicated_ for what I needed. So I made a minimal CMS for my needs and it worked great.
