**A few weeks ago** I decided that my site needed to change. It was already pretty simple but I wanted to simplify it even further.

I've endeavoured to make this blog about all things _unrelated_ to my work and instead focus on art, writing, travel, and micro-adventures. I'm still going to focus on those things.

**Cleaned up**

I have removed a lot of old posts. I hand-picked posts to keep and have archived the resst where they are not publicly accessible.

**Using Jekyll**

When I launched _rotub.me_ in January 2011, I built my own CMS from scratch. Using my custom CMS was fine over that last 4 years, but I'm happy to move on from it.

This time I am using Jekyll. It's very simple and doesn't require a database. It's also being hosted for free on Github.com which is nice too.
