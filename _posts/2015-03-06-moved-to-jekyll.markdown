I've been running this blog for a few years now.

I've made an effort to make this website about all things outside of work and the web. Instead, I have focused on writing, art, travel, and micro-adventures.

For this post I want to touch on my thought process while updating this website in the past few weeks.

**Minimal needs**

Recently I decided my website needed an update, and to be simplified even further. I love simplifying things, whether it be code, process, thoughts, or my freaking bedroom.
