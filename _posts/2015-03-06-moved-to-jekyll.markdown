**A few weeks ago** I decided that my site needed to change. It was already pretty simple but I wanted to simplify it even further.

I've endeavoured to make this blog about all things _unrelated_ to my work and instead focus on art, writing, travel, and micro-adventures. I'm still going to focus on those things.

**Cleaned up**

I have removed a lot of old posts. I hand-picked posts to keep and have archived the rest. They are not publicly accessible.

**Using Jekyll**

When I launched _rotub.me_ in January 2011, I built my own CMS which was fine for using over the last 4 years, but I'm happy to be moving on from it.

This time I am using Jekyll. I chose Jekyll because it is not a CMS, it doesn't require a database, and it can be hosted on Github Pages for free.

I use prose.io to add new posts and github issues to upload and host images.

This rotub.me overhaul has been an opportunity to play with some technology such as github, markup language, sass, ruby, and npm. All of which I've been wanting to explore but did not have a use for them until now.
