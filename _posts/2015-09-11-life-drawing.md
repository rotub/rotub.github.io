Learning to draw is hard - really hard. I've been teaching myself how to draw faces and it's not easy. We spend all day looking at faces and instead of that making drawing easier it makes it feel impossible. I find this really interesting.

#### Brain pain

We know what human faces look like so when we look at a sketch and something is even slightly off it looks hilariously bad.

Our brain is an expert at judging a face but it also thinks it's so smart that when its self attempts to draw it simplifies what a face looks like and turns out those assumptions are wrong. The result is a shitty drawing that even it - the expert - can see is completely off and it gets confused why it couldn't produce something amazing with its expert knowledge.

We think we know everything but we actually know nothing. We can see what is wrong but we can't create what is right.

#### Guesstimation illustration

We assume, estimate, and fill in the gaps of what we see around us. If we look closely, we see something different - we see more. Things are nowhere near as simple as they seem. Life is complicated - even when it seems simple on the surface. Turns out the same goes for people and their faces. They look simple but they are complicated.

Once I understood this I figured if I get pretty good at drawing faces then surely drawing objects and cartoons will be a lot easier.

Drawing realism from a photo takes a lot of time. It probably takes me an hour to get anything half-decent. It's weird starting with blank paper and thinking 'with this pencil and a bunch of lines I'm going to reproduce this photograph'. It looks impossible and even more so when you know your brain is working against you.

I didn't get into drawing to learn realism. But every time I draw something I feel like I'm _almost there_. It almost looks right. The eyes are just a bit too small, the nose is the wrong shape, or the ears are too low, etc. It feels good to be aware of and acknowledge what is wrong and make me feel like the next time it will be correct - so I find myself trying again.
