**Many weeks ago** I decided that my site needed to change and I have finally got around to doing something about it.

I launched this site in January 2011 as a space to explore, experiment, and share my thoughts and experiences. I have taken time over the past few weeks to look at what this blog means to me and made some changes.

**Cleaned up**

A few posts over the years have received a lot of attention. I hand-picked those posts and a few others... and have archived the rest. They are not publicly accessible.

**Keeping focus**

I've endeavoured to keep this blog focused on all things _unrelated_ to my work and instead focus on art, writing, travel, and micro-adventures. I'm still going to focus on those things.

**Using Jekyll**

When I launched _rotub.me_ in January 2011, I built my own CMS which has worked great over the last 4 years, but I'm happy to be moving on from it.

This time I am using Jekyll. I chose Jekyll because it is not a CMS, it doesn't require a database, and it can be hosted on Github Pages for free.

Moving forward I will use prose.io to add new posts and github issues to upload and host images.

This rotub.me overhaul has been an opportunity to play with some technology such as github, markdown, sass, ruby, and npm. All of which I have wanted to explore but did not have a use (excuse) for until now.
