#### All you need to know about working for Deliveroo in Amsterdam

Do you live in the Netherlands and considering joining Deliveroo as a rider?

I joined Deliveroo in September 2017 after moving to Amsterdam from Australia on a Working Holiday Visa.

I couldn't find information online about the job - like how much it pays and other general details. So I have been gathering data on my experience for the past 6 months. I'm sharing these statistics with you so you can see what it entails and make a judgement call on whether it suits your needs. In return, if you do decide to sign up - enter my referal code, **RO120601**, when [applying](http://roo.it/RO120601 "Apply here"). You will receieve a bonus for doing so - at the time of writing the bonus is €100.

I've worked more than 94 shifts and completed over 743 deliveries from 254 restaurants.

#### How much do you get paid?

The base rate as a freelancer is €5 per delivery.

I find on average I can manage 3 deliveries per hour.

On top of the base there are also incentives - for example in winter I was paid €1 extra per delivery as well as bonuses for delivering certain amounts of orders i.e. _do 75 orders this pay cycle (2 weeks) and get an extra €70_.

So it's possible to make €15~ per hour. In reality I have been making between €12.06/hr - €15.20/hr.

**What about tips?**

I've only tracked the tips given through the app - I get about the same again or maybe even more in cash! Tips from the app are paid at the end of each pay cycle with your pay packet. Every 2 weeks.

Since starting I have got €296 in tips. Which is about €3~ per shift on average. Including cash tips it's probably double that or a little more.

The most I have got in tips from one shift is €13 (plus cash). The most I have received from 1 customer is €7.

#### How much cycling do you actually do?

Since day one I have completed 743 deliveries. The most I have done in one shift is 14.

I have used Google timeline to track distance cycled while working.

I've cycled 2225km since starting. That's an average of 23km per shift and 3km per delivery.

The most I have cycled in one shift is 44.6km, the shortest is 10.3km.

#### What is the weather like?

Out of 94 days ... 65 days it has rained. That's 68% of the time.

Most of my shifts have been at peak times between 5pm-10pm too so that means I usually get near the coldest time of day. Here are the stats I have on weather while working:

- Rain days:	65
- Snow days:	8
- Warmest day:	14C
- Coldest day:	-9C
- Subzero days:	23

Rain and snow are actually a blessing in disguise. It means there are less people out on the road to get in your way.

Surprisingly, the temperature plays zero part in getting tips - I have worked for 4 hours on a -6C night (it wasn't raining) and received ZERO tips all night. However on a relatively warm night when it was raining I receieved a lot of tips! People pity the rain, but they're used to the cold temperatures it seems.
