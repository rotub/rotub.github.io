I turn 27 next week.

This is a list of my top 5 life experiences so far.

A lot of time, effort, and/or luck was involved in the following experiences to take place. I often look back on them for inspiration, lessons learned, feelings felt, and fond memories.

**5. China, my first trip overseas without family**

I experienced life in China as a local, not only as a tourist. For one month I stayed with my friend's family who lives in Fuzhou, and from there travelled to many major cities and attractions. Returning to Fuzhou between each touristy stint was always a highlight.

**4. Completing university**

I never thought I would go to university, I didn't put any value on it. I finally made the personal decision after 3 years of full time work that hands on experience isn't always everything. A few years later, I walked out of UTS with a Bachelor of Business, Management. It demonstrated how far i had come and mentally grown since school.

**3. Cycling across Borneo**

Sometimes (or probably most of the time) the best things in life are not planned.

When my brother and I decided to cycle across Borneo in a spur of the moment, it triggered an unforgettable experience, and changed my outlook on life.

**2. Guatemala**

I've travelled to a lot of countries now and I think it's safe to say that Guatemala has been my favourite so far. This trip was so good. It had all the elements of traveling that I enjoy. That is adventure, hiking, tuk-tuks (and chicken buses), risk, poverty (only because it helps me appreciate what is back at home), colours, and camping.

**1. Skateboarding 85km from Sydney to Wollongong**

In early 2013 I skateboarded 85km from Sydney to Wollongong. It took 12 hours. To this day it has been the best and most fulfilling experience.

**0. Now, and the future**

Looking at these top 5 experiences, they are nearly in sequential order. Which tells me each new experience gets better and better, and therefore there is much to look forward to.
