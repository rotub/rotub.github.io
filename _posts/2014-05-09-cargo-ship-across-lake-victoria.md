> I travelled from Tanzania to Uganda on a cargo ship.

**No ferry for you**

There used to be a public ferry connecting Uganda and Tanzania. The ferry no longer runs.

The immigration officer in Mwanza's  South Port however enables (for those who seek it) an alternative means of getting to Uganda - via cargo ship.

At this point, I was more than four weeks into my 3 month East Africa trip so I had already used airplanes, ferries, and buses; having a new and different option was awesome.

Speaking to the immigration officer was, in true Tanzanian style, a little awkward. However, he assured me that a ship was leaving "today or tomorrow"

He gave me his personal number to call him in the afternoon to confirm whether my ship would be leaving that day or the following.

"11am." He told me "Come to my office at 10am." I hung up the phone 65% convinced that this was going to happen.

**Africa time**

I rocked up to the port at 10am and the immigration officer stamped my passport out of Tanzania. It was definitely happening.

Not any time soon though. The 11am departure time quickly turned into 12pm, which turned into 2pm, etc. etc. and we finally set off at 5.45pm. In case you didn't notice that means I waited for 8 hours at south port for the boat to leave because it was always leaving "anytime now."

The reason for the delay was because about 30 guys were loading the boat with wheat. 80kg per bag. One of these guys is pictured below. There had to be 1000's of bags. It took them 2 days to fill the boat (i'd seen them doing the same the night before)

**Costs**

I paid more than $50US which I knew was too much but I was regrettably in no mood for haggling. I handed over what Tanzanian shillings I had left. I figured I was leaving the country anyway.

In hindsight I wish I'd put up a bit of a fight. On board I found out that transport was $30US, plus more for a room, plus 4000tsh for food. The immigration officer had only given them $30US of my money and pocketed the rest. With some convincing and a phone call to the immigration douchebag, I didn't have to pay the difference.

If you take this journey, insist on paying the captain directly. Don't let the immigration officer pay him for you. A silly mistake on my lazy behalf. It's always that one time you let your guard down.

**On the water**

Despite paying more than expected, the experience turned out to be a thousand times better than a bus or plane. The actual boat ride was great fun! The captains righthand 'first mate' gave me his room, bathroom, and shower with hot water, while he slept elsewhere or not at all. It was obvious he wanted me to really enjoy my time. He seemed proud of his boat and his job.

The chief engineer showed us around the engine, generator and steering rooms which was pretty interesting to say the least. 

Everyone on board was friendly and welcoming.

We had 3 meals on board: dinner, breakfast, and lunch. We sat at a round table with the crew. 26 crew members were on the boat but I only saw 4-5 at a time. We ate bananas, chicken, rice, eggs. The food was quite good.

Most of the crew spoke OK but limited English.

**Hello Uganda**

We crashed into a smaller boat when pulling into the dock which sent me a few feet across my room (it was the other boats fault for sitting in our way apparently), but not too much damage done and everything went smoothly the second attempt once the small boat moved.

The first mate showed the way to the Ugandan immigration officer where I was approved a 2 months visa for $50US. I thanked my new friend and left quickly, as he was being heavily questioned about some of the Tanzanians on board who were not documented as "passengers" nor "crew members". She was not granting them access into Uganda. I hope that worked out for him because he was an awesome, genuinely nice dude.

Overall it was quite an experience. If you are heading to/from Tanzania/Uganda it's definitely worth looking into it.
