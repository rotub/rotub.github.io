####Drawing - week one

I made a concious decision to get better at drawing as it is something I've always been interested in but never pursued because I'm not confident in using my hands.

I started seeing progress after 2 months when I drew a self-portrait that actually looks like me.

I'm happy with my progress but I feel like I have been rushing. I've been focused on the outcome, not the learning.

So I decided to go back to the basics. This week I have been drawing spheres and cubes.

####Boooring

As you might expect it's really boring drawing what is essentially circles and squares. I feel like I'm in pre-school again.

> It should be accurate, not perfect.

When I draw something I want it to look like something. I want it to look like what I see. But really I should be focusing on proportion and shading.

Proportion, perspective, and shading literally dictate how a finished drawing will look. If I get those right (or accurate) the drawing looks much better, even if it looks to be lacking finer details.

So in that respect drawing circles and squares isn't boring as much it is necessary.

####Getting creative

Even when I believe this... drawing circles still sucks. So I got creative and turned circles into very simple characters. I made them an exact sphere so when I draw them sideways or on an angle I can still start with a _perfect_ circle and let the shading and placement of arms/legs create illusions of which way the characters are facing.

Next week I will try drawing more abstract shapes ay different angles.
