####Drawing - week one

I made a concious decision to get better at drawing as it is something I've always been interested in but never pursued because I'm not confident in using my hands.

I started seeing progress after 2 months when I drew a self-portrait that actually looks like me.

I'm happy with my progress but I feel like I have been rushing. I've been focused on the outcome, not the learning.

So I decided to go back to the basics. This week I have been drawing spheres and cubes.

As you might expect it's really boring drawing what is essentially circles and squares. I feel like I'm in pre-school again.

_After drawing a few spheres I get bored. I try drawing a face instead. Somehow the face just doesn't look right. I'm going backwards!_

> It should be accurate, not perfect.

When I draw something I want it to be perfect. I want it to look like what I see. But really I should be focusing on the proportion and shading. I've noticed proportion and shading only take a few moments to make or break a drawing.

I expected the finer details to be the hard part. But they're actually the fun part.

Proportion, perspective, and shading literally dictate how the finished drawing will look. If I get those right (or accurate) the drawing looks much better even if it looks to be lacking finer details

After all, we can tell who someone is by their silhouette. So we should be able to draw someone's outline and already know who it is without filling in the finer details.

So in that respect drawing circles and squares isn't boring as much it is necessary.
