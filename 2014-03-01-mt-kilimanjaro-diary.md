My daily notes while treking up Mt. Kilimanjaro via the Machame "Whiskey" route.

**Day 1 (5 hours)**

While not easy, it was easier than expected. Talking to my group members and getting to know them probably helped time go faster. I did a lot of sweating but not much puffing. Elevation here is 3025m. Sore ankles but other than that all good so far. Played cards with my two Danish friends. Also looked up to see a clear night sky with many stars.

**Day 2 (5 hours)**

About the same difficulty as yesterday but steeper. More clambering over large rocks and boulders. Feet are sore. Everything else is alright. Arrived to camp with porters singing the Kilimanjaro song. I'm taking it pole-pole which helps. Feeling good. Elevation here is 3800m. We will do an acclimatizing walk to 4000m at 4pm, if it does not rain.

**Day 2.1 (1.5 hours)**

Climbed to 4000m. Felt good all the way. Not sure if slight headache is from altitude or my hat being too small. A bit nervous about altitude. 20% of people will have to turn back due to sickness. Tomorrow is a 7 hour hike. As is the next day, and the day after that.

**Day 3 (7 hours)**

Woke up feeling good. Slept through the night except needed to pee at 5:10am. View of the stars was worth getting out of the tent. Hiked to 4600m today. No obvious altitude problems yet. After lunch we descended to 3900m. Sore ankles from hopping rocks. A lot of rest now from 3pm until bedtime ~8pm. Another 7 hours tomorrow to 4800m on the other side of the mountain.

**Day 4 (7 hours)**

Longest day so far, although we stopped for lunch and had a cooked meal instead of a packed lunch. Lots of up and down today. Reached 4800m campsite, the tents look awesome amongst the rocks. Now we can have a quick nap before dinner (5:30pm) and then sleep until 11pm. We should summit at sunrise 7 hours later. Today was probably the hardest day. Two of our friends from another group wished they were doing 6 days instead of 7 as they waved us off. At this point i'm glad to have picked 6 days. The 2 hikes seperated by lunch weren't too long or taxing. Pole-pole.

**Day 5 (10 hours)**

I woke up at 10pm. 2 hours sleep. The wind was very strong. It sounded cold. I lay in my tent for 1 hour in my full gear - 5 layers on top, 3 on the bottom. We had tea and biscuits at 11pm and started walking at 12am.

This was definitely the hardest day. That may be because we did 6 days instead of 7, where we would have had a lot more rest and preperation for summit day. It was very dark, very cold, very windy, and we walked very slowly (pole-pole); I just watched my guides feet in front of me and occassionally regretted looking up the face of the mountain at the zig zag shaped line of head torches. There was always much further to walk.

I felt pretty good all the way up to the summit. My friend Uli had some scary moments where he got very dizzy. He told me later he didn't remember anything of the climb. We started stopping a lot which made us more cold, and gave us more time to think about how much further there was to go.

I was ready for the summit about 3/4 of the way through. It was no where to be seen though. Just a zig zag line of head torches.

We reached the summit at 7:05am. Sunrise. Perfect timing, as our guide had promised. We took our token photos and looked around feeling very lucky about the clear skies.

I developed a slight headache as we were leaving the summit so I ran down the slopes, following our guides who were helping Uli reach more oxygen as he was still looking and feeling pretty bad. I got a really sore stomach half way down to camp. I threw up a little bit. I blame my lack of water more than altitude. My water froze on the way up which meant I only had 1.5 litres for a 10 hour hike (up and down); other days I drank at least 3 litres for only 5-7 hours.

When we reached camp I collapsed in my tent and had a quick nap before lunch, followed by another 3-4 hour hike down to a low altitude camp for our last night.

**Day 6 (3 hours)**

We were very excited that the 3 of us made it. Walking for 3-4 hours yesterday after my nap was hard. Going down hill is just as bad if not worse than going up. Today we walked for 3 hours back to the bus. It was long and we were sore. But we talked most the way down and it was actually nice.

I did it! I climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro via the Machame route. It's a great experience. I'm glad to have done 6 days because it made the summit climb that much harder. Which made the top that much sweeter.
