I am a front end developer and wanna-be minimalist at <a href='//www.virginmobile.com.au'>Virgin Mobile</a>. I enjoy building and simplifying websites. I have worked at a handful of agencies and corporate companies including Chook, UrsaClemenger, Optus, and Virgin Mobile.

I have broad knowledge and skills having completed a 3-year Bachelor of Business at UTS, while remaining hands-on in website development. I can see and approach projects from many angles - design, UX, development, HR, project management, etc - and understand that good things come from all these combined.

I created <a href='//www.movii.es'>Moviies</a> which was labelled as possibly "the best new movie website in Australia" in an <a href='http://www.cnet.com/au/news/is-this-the-best-new-movie-website-in-australia/'>article</a> by CNET Australia.

I keep life interesting by traveling, surfing, writing, and challenging myself in various other ways- most notably '<a href='/blog/my-skate-of-mind'>My Skate of Mind</a>' where I skateboarded 85km from Sydney to Wollongong in 12 hours which was picked up and acknowledged by various websites and online personalities including: <a href='//www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/02/this-guy-probably-had-a-crazier-weekend-than-you-did/'>Gizmodo AU</a>, <a href='//medium.com/this-happened-to-me/my-skate-of-mind-6970a7b48906'>Medium</a>, <a href='//www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/05/briefly-victoria-cracks-down-on-clueless-taxis-free-ebooks-can-xbox-one-secretly-spy-on-you/'>Lifehacker AU</a>, <a href='//twitter.com/wollongong_nsw/status/339520163462406147'>Wollongong NSW</a>, <a href='//twitter.com/Webjet_US/status/323828285589045248'>Webjet</a>, and others.
