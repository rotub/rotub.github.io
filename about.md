I am a front end developer and wanna-be minimalist at <a href='//www.virginmobile.com.au'>Virgin Mobile</a>. I enjoy building and simplifying online and offline experiences. I have worked at a handful of agencies and corporate companies including Chook, UrsaClemenger, Optus, and now Virgin Mobile.

By completing my 3-year Bachelor of Business at UTS I have broadened my knowledge and skills, while remaining hands-on in website development. I can now see and approach projects from many angles - design, UX, development, HR, project management, etc - and understand that good things come from all these combined.

I am the founder and developer behind <a href='//www.moviies.com.au'>Moviies</a> which is my pet side project.

Offline I keep life interesting by traveling, surfing, writing, and challenging myself in various ways- most notably '<a href='/blog/my-skate-of-mind'>My Skate of Mind</a>' where I skateboarded 85km from Sydney to Wollongong in 12 hours.
