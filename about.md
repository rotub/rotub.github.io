My name is Rohan Nowell.

I'm a website developer working for Virgin Mobile in Sydney.

I have previously worked for Optus, Chook, and UrsaClemenger.

I graduated from UTS with a Bachelor of Business.

In 2013, I skateboarded 85km from Sydney to Wollongong in 12 hours.

Moviies and Rotub\*HN are my latest side projects.
